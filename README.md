# Scorchio

This is a small web-app that serves as a prototype for a 'live' phone background.

The elements on screen vary depending on the weather, with cloud, rain, snow, mist, stars, sunsets, sunrises, and lightning effects. 

To access this information, it calls the OpenWeather API, however the weather, time and city can be artifically modified on the site.

To view the project live go here: 'to be added'
